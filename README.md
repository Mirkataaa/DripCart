DripCart is an e-commerce project for clothing and footwear, built as a way to explore how a real online store could be structured and implemented.
The project focuses on core e-commerce functionality such as product listings, authentication, and user interaction, while experimenting with modern tools and patterns used in production-grade applications.
Development is currently paused, but the project has a clear roadmap and is planned to be completed and refined over time as part of ongoing learning and portfolio work.
